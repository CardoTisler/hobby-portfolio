The desk features a straightforward ash tabletop paired with wenge breadboard ends that provide visual contrast. These breadboard elements serve a dual purpose: they create an aesthetic accent while functioning as structural stabilizers to maintain the desk's flatness and accommodate natural wood movement.

A practical slot has been incorporated into the far end of the table surface to route electrical wiring and accommodate a wall socket, allowing the desk to be positioned directly against a wall. The base components were sourced from Seisuk.
