Continued the black-and-white theme with a horizontal-layer approach. Black and white walls, dark oak parquet and black ceiling.

Due to a very uneven floor, the parquet became very noisy when walking over it, so a year later the decision was made to pull everything up and pour a new floor with fiber concrete. I'd say this reduced the noises made by the parquet by 90%.
